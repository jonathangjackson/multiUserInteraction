# IMD 3901 - A3
I created a slingshot game multiplayer game for web on desktop. Their are two stages to this game:
  Stage 1 - Place the targets: Both players can place a target by pressing the 1 key and the target spwawns at the player's location and        rotation in both scenes. To move press horizontally use the (w-a-s-d) keys and the mouse orientation is forwards. In order to move          vertically use the up and down arrows. This stage takes 60 seconds and once the first user's time runs out then both players move onto      stage 2.
  Stage 2 - Hit the targets: Both Players can spawn bullets from their location and depending on their proximity to the slingshot(the two        cubes) then their direction and speed are altered through physics. Player's score points by hitting the targets. The player with the        most points after all the targets are hit wins.
  
Challengs:
  A major challenge was understanding the breif of the assigment as the most effective way of implementing the requirements is to use networked a-frame but as stated in a later e-mail we aren't allowed to use this. 

Success:
  I found out on Friday that networked aframe wasn't allowed this didn't impact me too bad as during my development i implemented my game mechanics before implementing the networking so I was able to reset to a previous build.
